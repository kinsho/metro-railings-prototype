The Next.JS version of Metro Railings

When I was younger and in a more rebellious phase of my life, I launched a construction company and wrote the code base 
for the public website and customer relationship management platform using nothing but vanilla Node.JS and 
ECMAScript 6. At the time, I was proud to have built a fully-functional CRM free from the constraints of any 
opinionated frameworks...but over the years, maintaining such a 
code base proved quite cumbersome, especially as I was trying to outsource the coding of new features for the 
CRM platform. 

Finally, I had enough - I rewrote the entire code base using the Next.JS framework. It took a few 
years of research and development, but by October of 2024, I finally modernized the entire code and released it into production.

This GitHub repo has been copied from the production codebase and slightly tweaked in order to serve as a demo 
showcasing the platform I built for my construction company. Real-world data has been used to populate orders inside 
the CRM. All personally identifiable data has been scrambled.
